Platform to handle various modules of SoServ research project


## Installation

In order to be able to run this software, some modules are required to be installed, which are specified in requirements.txt. Install the dependencies by executing:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Furthermore you will need PostgreSQL to store users. Please refer to any of their installation guides for you OS.
Once PostgreSQL is installed, you will need to create a user and database. Open a Postgres Shell as postgres user:
```sh
$ sudo -u postgres psql
```
Next, create the following user and database:
```sh
$ CREATE DATABASE sse;
CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'admin_password_goes_here';
GRANT ALL ON DATABASE sse TO admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO admin;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA public TO admin;
```
The tables will be created automatically on server startup. However, if you wish to generate them manually, execute the following command:
```sh
$ sudo -u postgres psql -U postgres -d sse < create_tables.sql
```


## Running the platform

To run this API, you will need an SSL Certificate and the corrensponding SSL key. Those artifacts need to be supplied via config (in JSON format). An example config is present in the repo.

If you do not already have SSL credentials, you can generate a self-signed certificate by executing:

```sh
$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.key -out cert.crt -days 365
```

The config also needs to specify the connection details for your database. Please see the example config for the neccessary keys.

To run the platform, execute the following command:

```sh
$ python3 main.py -c path/to/config.json [--dev] [--create_admin]
```

Mandatory arguments:
- -c : the path to the json config file

Optional arguments:
- --dev : developer mode, no authentication is required to access the api endpoints
- --create_admin : automatically create an admin account on the platform. Credentials will be read from the config. See the example config for the required keys


## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and can be found [here](https://sse-platform.readthedocs.io).

#### Building the Docs yourself

If you require to build the docs yourself, you need to install Sphinx. Please refer to their [Installation guide](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html) for instructions.
Secondly, you need to install the HTTP templates for Sphinx as well as JSDoc to ensure building the documentation of the frontend:

```sh
$ pip install sphinxcontrib-httpdomain
$ npm install -g jsdoc
```

To now build the docs, navigate into the docs/ directory and execute:

```sh
$ make html
```

The freshly built docs will be in docs/build/html.


## Tests

Tests are implemented with [Pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/index.html). Please refer to their [guide](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html) for installation.

Once you installed Pytest, you also need to install the tornado plugin:
```sh
$ pip install pytest-tornado
```

to run the tests, simply execute:
```sh
$ pytest
```


## Contributing a module

In order to build a module there are certain rules and steps to do to ensure your module is working properly. (As this platform is in alpha state, please not that this information is subject to change):

1. Your only way of communication with the platform is via a websocket connection.
  Our modules all use the same client class. Feel free to also use this websocket client in your module. you can find it in socket_client.py. Please note: You have to change the names of your module in the placeholders (lines 23, 60, 78, 87). Keep in mind to use the exact same name everywhere (also when communicating with the platform (later steps)).
    If you aim to use this socket client class without modification, you also need to use the token_cache_client.py to store the information about the currently active users. Copy it into your module, it should work out of the box with the socket client.

2. To establish a connection and to communicate with the platform your messages have to be digitally signed. There is a script (signing.py) that provides the generation of a sign and verify key. Execute this script, and you will receive two files: signing_key.key and verify_key.key . Keep those in your modules directory. Keep the signing key secret at all cost. Copy the verify key from the file into the verify_keys.json at the platform. Remember to use the same name as in step 1.

3. You should be good to go. To initiate a WebSocket connection with the platform and make the platform recognize your module, use the following code snippet:
```python3
client = await get_socket_instance()
response = await client.write({"type": "module_start",
                               "module_name": "<your_module_name_here>",
                               "port": <free_port_here>})
# if response["status"] == "recognized":
      # you now have an established connection with the platform
```
Again, use the same name as in steps 1 and 2.

Once your module is ready for use, commit and create a pull request to [this](https://github.com/Smunfr/sse-platform-modules) repository. Please consider only pushing production-ready code to this repository, do not use it for development.
